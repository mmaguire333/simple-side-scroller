# Simple Side Scroller
This project is an implementation of a simple sidescroller/platformer game in which the user controls a character that progresses through the game by running and jumping on platforms. The overall structure of the code for this project, and in particular the game engine class, is based on a [video series from freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OKdSHRlfA).

This implementation is fairly simple and is only meant to be a rough draft or proof of concept in which my goal was to learn about things like animation on the html canvas, game loops, tilemaps, collision detection and response, and spritesheet animation among other things. Currently it only contains one level and the character is only able to run and jump. Possible next steps to improve the game could be to add more levels, implement controls for mobile users, add enemies with a combat system, or create a score system with a leaderboard.
